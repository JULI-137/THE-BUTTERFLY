# THE-BUTTERFLY

A man👨 found a cocoon of a butterfly 🦋.
One day a small opening appeared. He sat and watched the butterfly 🦋 for several hours🕐 as it struggled to force its body through that little hole.
Until it suddenly stopped making any progress and looked like it was stuck.So the man decided to help the butterfly 🦋.He took a pair of scissors ✂️ and snipped off,the remaining bit of the cocoon.The butterfly 🦋 then emerged easily,although it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.
The man didn't think of anything of it and sat there waiting for the wings to enlarge to support the butterfly 🦋. But that didn't happen. The butterfly 🦋 spend the rest of its life unable to fly, crawling around with tiny wings and a swollen body.
Despite the kind heart💖 of the man,he didn't understand that the restricting cocoon and the struggle needed by the butterfly 🦋 to get itself through the small opening; were God's👼 way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into it's wings. To prepare itself for flying once it was out of the cocoon.

MORAL OF THE STORY:

Our struggles in life develop our strengths. Without struggles,we never grow and never get stronger,So it's important for us to tackle challenge on our own,and not be relying on help from others.
